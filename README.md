# Email Spam Detection - README
# Overview
Welcome to the Email Spam Detection repository. This project was developed during an internship at Afame Technologies, where I worked as a Machine Learning Intern. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately detect spam emails using a Naive Bayes classifier. The model achieves an impressive 98% accuracy on the spam detection dataset.

# Project Description
Email spam detection is a crucial task in the modern digital era to ensure safe and efficient communication. This project leverages a Naive Bayes classifier to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. The model has been trained and tested on a spam detection dataset and demonstrates a high level of accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a well-known spam detection dataset. It contains email messages labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam). The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure optimal performance of the Naive Bayes model.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pushpasri-M/AfameTechnology.git
# Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd AfameTechnology
# Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
# Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install -U scikit-learn
# Usage
To train and test the spam detection model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Naive Bayes model, and evaluate its performance. The results, including the accuracy score, will be displayed in the console.
